## Implementation Details

### Advanced Drift Detection System

The drift detection system uses multiple statistical tests to identify changes in data distributions. It compares the distribution of new data with the distribution of the training data used for the models. When significant drift is detected, the system generates a report with recommendations for model retraining.

The system includes:
- Statistical tests for distribution comparison
- Visual tools for distribution analysis
- Automated reporting with recommendations
- Integration with the online learning framework

### Hybrid Retrieval System

The hybrid retrieval system combines vector-based semantic search with traditional keyword-based search. It uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar documents and keyword indexing to find documents containing specific terms. The results are combined using configurable weights and can be reranked for improved relevance.

The system includes:
- Vector indexing for semantic search
- Keyword indexing for term matching
- Result combination with configurable weights
- Reranking for improved relevance
- Metadata filtering for faceted search

### Automated Market Report Generator

The market report generator creates comprehensive reports with data visualizations, insights, and recommendations. It uses templates to generate consistent reports and can output in multiple formats. The reports include price trends, forecasts, risk assessments, and trading signals.

The system includes:
- Data gathering and analysis
- Visualization generation
- Natural language insight generation
- Risk assessment calculation
- Trading signal generation
- Template-based report generation

### Online Learning Framework

The online learning framework enables continuous model improvement with new data. It includes a model registry for version management, evaluation metrics for model comparison, and integration with the drift detection system. When significant drift is detected, the system can automatically retrain models with new data.

The system includes:
- Model registry for version management
- Evaluation metrics for model comparison
- Drift detection integration
- Automated model retraining
- Performance tracking

## Usage Guidelines

### Advanced Drift Detection System

To use the drift detection system:
1. Ensure you have both training data and new data for comparison
2. Run the drift detection module to compare the distributions
3. Review the drift report and recommendations
4. If significant drift is detected, consider retraining the models

Example command:
```bash
python src/monitoring/run_drift_detection.py --commodity crude_oil --threshold 0.05
```

### Hybrid Retrieval System

To use the hybrid retrieval system:
1. Formulate your query in natural language
2. Adjust the weights between semantic and keyword search if needed
3. Set any metadata filters to narrow down the search
4. Run the search and review the results

Example command:
```bash
python src/rag/retrieval/run_hybrid_retrieval.py --query "OPEC production cuts impact on crude oil prices" --top-k 5
```

### Automated Market Report Generator

To generate market reports:
1. Select the commodities to include in the report
2. Set the date range and forecast horizon
3. Choose the report template and output format
4. Run the report generator

Example command:
```bash
python src/gen_ai/reporting/run_market_report.py --commodities crude_oil natural_gas gasoline diesel
```

### Online Learning Framework

To use the online learning framework:
1. Configure the update frequency and thresholds
2. Select the commodities and model types to update
3. Run the online learning manager
4. Review the update results and performance metrics

Example command:
```bash
python src/models/run_online_learning.py --commodities crude_oil --model-types arima xgboost lstm price_drivers
```
