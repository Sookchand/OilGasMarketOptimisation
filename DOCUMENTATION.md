## How to Make the Best Use of the System

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Data Management page**:
   - Generate sample data for all commodities or individual ones
   - Explore the generated data through visualizations
   - This step is essential as other modules depend on this data

2. **Explore the Trading Dashboard**:
   - Select a commodity from the dropdown
   - Choose a trading strategy (Moving Average Crossover or RSI)
   - Adjust strategy parameters to see how they affect performance
   - Analyze the performance metrics and trading signals

3. **Assess Risk in the Risk Analysis page**:
   - View return statistics for your selected commodity
   - Adjust confidence level and time horizon for VaR calculations
   - Run Monte Carlo simulations with different parameters
   - Analyze the distribution of returns and potential portfolio values

### Advanced Usage

4. **Leverage Predictive Analytics**:
   - Use multiple forecasting models to predict future prices
   - Compare model performance and select the best one
   - Optimize production levels based on price forecasts
   - Plan maintenance schedules to minimize downtime

5. **Conduct Risk Assessment**:
   - Analyze market risks and review hedging recommendations
   - Monitor geopolitical events that could impact supply chains
   - Track regulatory changes and assess their potential impact
   - Evaluate portfolio diversification opportunities

6. **Utilize Decision Support**:
   - Create and compare different market scenarios

   - Optimize supply chain networks for efficiency

### Best Practices

- **Start with Data Management**: Always ensure you have data loaded before using other modules
- **Compare Multiple Strategies**: Test different trading strategies and parameter combinations
- **Consider Multiple Risk Metrics**: Don't rely on a single risk measure; use VaR, Monte Carlo, and stress testing
- **Combine Forecasts**: Use ensemble methods by considering predictions from multiple models
- **Update Regularly**: Regenerate data and rerun analyses to capture changing market conditions
- **Document Decisions**: Keep track of the scenarios and parameters that led to specific decisions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Generation

The system generates synthetic data that mimics real-world commodity price movements using:

```python
def generate_price_data(start_date, periods=1000, volatility=0.02, drift=0.001):
    """Generate synthetic price data with random walk."""
    np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
    returns = np.random.normal(drift, volatility, periods)
    price = 100  # Starting price
    prices = [price]
    
    for ret in returns:
        price *= (1 + ret)
        prices.append(price)
    
    dates = pd.date_range(start=start_date, periods=periods+1, freq='D')
    df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': dates, 'Price': prices})
    df.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
    
    return df
```

### Trading Strategy Implementation

The Moving Average Crossover strategy is implemented as:

```python
def moving_average_crossover(df, short_window=20, long_window=50):
    """Implement Moving Average Crossover strategy."""
    signals = pd.DataFrame(index=df.index)
    signals['price'] = df['Price']
    signals['short_mavg'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=short_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['long_mavg'] = df['Price'].rolling(window=long_window, min_periods=1).mean()
    signals['signal'] = 0.0
    
    # Create signals
    signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(
        signals['short_mavg'][short_window:] > signals['long_mavg'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
    
    # Generate trading orders
    signals['positions'] = signals['signal'].diff()
    
    return signals
```

### Risk Calculation

Value at Risk (VaR) calculation:

```python
def calculate_var(returns, confidence_level=0.95, investment=100000):
    """Calculate Value at Risk."""
    # Historical VaR
    historical_var = np.percentile(returns, (1-confidence_level)*100)
    
    # Parametric VaR
    mean = returns.mean()
    std = returns.std()
    z_score = stats.norm.ppf(1-confidence_level)
    parametric_var = mean + z_score * std
    
    return {
        'historical_var': historical_var * investment,
        'parametric_var': parametric_var * investment
    }
```
