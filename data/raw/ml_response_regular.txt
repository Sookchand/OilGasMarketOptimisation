## Research Question: Forecasting Los Angeles Regular Gasoline Spot Prices

**Data Description:**

- Number of samples: 5553
- Features: Date, Los Angeles Reformulated RBOB Regular Gasoline Spot Price
- Target variable: Los Angeles Reformulated RBOB Regular Gasoline Spot Price (future values)
- Other relevant information: Time series data with a daily frequency.  Contains missing values.

## 1. Suitable Machine Learning Algorithms

This is a time series forecasting problem.  Suitable algorithms include:

* **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** A classic statistical model for time series forecasting that captures autocorrelations in the data.  Suitable for univariate time series like this one.
* **SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):** An extension of ARIMA that explicitly models seasonality.  Could be useful if there are weekly, monthly, or yearly patterns in gasoline prices.
* **Prophet (from Meta):** Designed for time series with strong seasonality and trend.  Handles missing data and holidays well.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks:** A type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Can be more complex to tune but potentially more powerful.
* **XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost (with time series features):** While not specifically time series models, gradient boosting algorithms can be effective when combined with appropriate feature engineering (e.g., lagged features, rolling statistics).

## 2. Feature Engineering Techniques

* **Date Features:** Extract day of week, month, year, quarter, week number, etc., to capture seasonality and trends.
* **Lagged Features:** Include past gasoline prices as features (e.g., price 1 day ago, 7 days ago, 30 days ago).
* **Rolling Statistics:** Calculate moving averages, rolling standard deviations, etc., to smooth the data and capture short-term trends.
* **External Data:** Consider incorporating relevant external data, such as crude oil prices, economic indicators, or holidays.  This would require joining with other datasets.
* **Time-based Splits:**  Crucially, use time-based splits for training and testing to avoid data leakage and ensure realistic evaluation.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**  Easy to interpret and gives a sense of the average prediction error in the original units (dollars per gallon).
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE.
* **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):**  Expresses the error as a percentage of the actual value.  Can be problematic if the target variable has values close to zero.
* **R-squared (R2):** Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.  Less suitable for time series than MAE or RMSE.


## 4. Python Libraries and Tools

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and time series handling.
* **scikit-learn:** For traditional machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
* **statsmodels:** For ARIMA and SARIMA models.
* **fbprophet:** For the Prophet model.
* **TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch:** For LSTM networks.
* **XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost:** For gradient boosting models.
* **matplotlib/seaborn:** For visualization.


## 5. Basic Implementation Approach (using Prophet)

```python
import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("Regular Gasoline.csv")

# Data preprocessing
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])  # Convert to datetime
df = df.dropna()  # Handle missing values (better imputation strategies might be needed)
df = df.rename(columns={'Los Angeles Reformulated RBOB Regular Gasoline Spot Price (Dollars per Gallon)': 'y', 'Date': 'ds'})

# Split data into train and test sets (time-based split)
split_date = '2022-01-01'  # Example split date, adjust as needed
train = df[df['ds'] < split_date]
test = df[df['ds'] >= split_date]

# Create and fit Prophet model
model = Prophet()
model.fit(train)

# Make predictions on the test set
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=len(test), freq='D')
forecast = model.predict(future)
predictions = forecast[forecast['ds'].isin(test['ds'])]['yhat']

# Evaluate the model
mae = mean_absolute_error(test['y'], predictions)
print(f"MAE: {mae}")

# Plot forecast
fig1 = model.plot(forecast)
fig2 = model.plot_components(forecast)
```

This is a simplified example.  Further steps would involve:

* More sophisticated feature engineering.
* Hyperparameter tuning for the chosen model.
* Comparing different models and selecting the best one.
* Potentially using cross-validation with a rolling window approach.
* Addressing any remaining seasonality or autocorrelation in the residuals.


This detailed response provides a solid starting point for tackling the gasoline price forecasting problem. Remember to adapt the code and techniques based on your specific needs and further data exploration.  Always critically evaluate the model's performance and consider the limitations of the chosen approach.
