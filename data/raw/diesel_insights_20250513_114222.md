## Analysis of Diesel Prices

**1. Dataset Summary**

* This dataset contains historical spot prices for ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel in three major U.S. markets: New York Harbor, U.S. Gulf Coast, and Los Angeles, CA.  The data spans a considerable time period, although the exact range isn't specified within the provided information.
* **Potential Use Cases:**
    * **Price Forecasting:** Predicting future diesel prices in these markets.
    * **Market Analysis:** Understanding price dynamics and relationships between different regional markets.
    * **Fuel Hedging:**  Informing hedging strategies for businesses dependent on diesel fuel.
    * **Supply Chain Optimization:**  Optimizing fuel purchasing and logistics based on price forecasts and market conditions.
    * **Policy Analysis:** Evaluating the impact of government policies on diesel prices.


**2. Data Quality Assessment**

* **Missing Values:** A significant number of missing values exist in the New York Harbor and U.S. Gulf Coast price columns (2547 each).  Los Angeles has only 8 missing values. This discrepancy requires careful handling and investigation. Are these missing values random, or do they represent a systematic issue?
* **Outliers:** While the provided statistics don't explicitly identify outliers, the large standard deviations relative to the means suggest their potential presence.  A visual inspection of the data (e.g., box plots, time series plots) is necessary to confirm and analyze outliers.
* **Potential Issues:** The substantial number of missing values in two of the three price columns is the most significant data quality issue.  The reason for these missing values needs to be determined.  Imputation or alternative data sources may be required.


**3. Key Patterns or Trends in the Data**

*  A thorough analysis of trends requires plotting the time series data. We expect to observe:
    * **Long-term trends:**  General upward or downward movement of prices over the entire period.
    * **Seasonality:**  Recurring patterns within a year (e.g., higher prices in winter due to heating oil demand).
    * **Cyclical patterns:**  Longer-term fluctuations related to economic cycles or other factors.
    * **Volatility:**  Periods of high price fluctuation.


**4. Interesting Relationships Between Variables**

* **Correlation between regional prices:**  We can calculate correlation coefficients to quantify the relationship between diesel prices in the three markets.  High correlation would suggest that prices move together, influenced by common factors.
* **Lagged relationships:**  Changes in one market might lead to changes in another after a certain time lag. This can be explored using cross-correlation analysis.


**5. Recommendations for Further Analysis or Visualization**

* **Time series plots:** Visualize the price data over time to identify trends, seasonality, and volatility.
* **Correlation matrix and scatter plots:** Examine the relationships between the three price series.
* **Autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis:**  Investigate lagged relationships within and between the time series.
* **Decomposition of time series:**  Separate the time series into its component parts (trend, seasonality, residuals) to better understand the underlying patterns.
* **Geographic visualization:** Map the price data to gain a spatial perspective on price variations.


**6. Potential Machine Learning Applications**

* **Predicting Los Angeles Diesel Prices:**

    * **Target Variable:** Los Angeles, CA Ultra-Low Sulfur CARB Diesel Spot Price
    * **Algorithms:** ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, Regression models (linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
    * **Preprocessing:** 
        * Handle missing values (imputation, removal).
        * Address outliers (winsorization, transformation).
        * Feature scaling (if necessary for some algorithms).
    * **Feature Engineering:** 
        * Lagged prices (e.g., price from previous week).
        * Moving averages.
        * Time-based features (day of week, month, year, holidays).
        * External factors (e.g., crude oil prices, economic indicators).
    * **Evaluation Metrics:**  RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
    * **Challenges:**  Non-stationarity of time series data, handling external shocks (e.g., geopolitical events), model selection and tuning.
    * **GenAI Integration:** GenAI can be used for automated feature engineering, exploring different model architectures (e.g., automatically generating and testing different combinations of hyperparameters), and explaining model predictions.  It could also be used to generate synthetic data to augment the training dataset, especially if data is limited.

* **Predicting New York and Gulf Coast Prices (with external data):**  Since these have many missing values, we could build models that leverage external datasets (e.g., crude oil prices, global diesel demand) and potentially the Los Angeles price as a predictor.

* **Anomaly Detection:**  Train a model to detect unusual price spikes or drops, which could indicate market disruptions or other events requiring investigation.


**Research Questions:**

1. **Target Variable:** The primary target variable in this dataset is the "Los Angeles, CA Ultra-Low Sulfur CARB Diesel Spot Price (Dollars per Gallon)."  Other potential target variables could be the New York Harbor and Gulf Coast prices.

2. **Predictive Modeling:** This data can be used for time series forecasting to predict future diesel prices.  Various models, as discussed above (ARIMA, LSTM, etc.), can be employed. Feature engineering, incorporating external data, and careful handling of missing values are crucial.

3. **Seasonal Patterns:**  It is likely that seasonal patterns exist in the data, such as higher prices during winter months due to increased heating oil demand.  Time series analysis and decomposition can reveal these patterns.

4. **Business Insights:**  This data can provide insights into price trends, market relationships, and volatility. Businesses can use these insights to make informed decisions about fuel purchasing, hedging strategies, and supply chain optimization.  Identifying periods of high price volatility can help mitigate risks.

5. **Handling Missing Values:** Several strategies can be used to handle missing values:
    * **Imputation:** Fill missing values using methods like mean/median imputation, linear interpolation, or more advanced techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors imputation.
    * **Deletion:** Remove rows with missing values (if the number of missing values is relatively small and doesn't introduce bias).
    * **Using external data:** If the missingness is related to data availability issues, explore alternative data sources to fill the gaps.  For example, if data is missing for specific periods, you might find data from other reporting agencies or market indices.
    * **Modeling the missingness:**  If the missing data is not random, you might build a separate model to predict the missing values based on other available information.

Key improvements and explanations:

1. **Clearer Data Loading and Preprocessing:**  Loads the data, converts the 'Date' column to datetime, and sets it as the index.  Handles missing values using KNN imputation, which is often more robust than simple mean/median imputation for time series data.

2. **Comprehensive EDA:** Includes time series plots, correlation analysis (heatmap), and seasonal decomposition to understand the data's characteristics.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Demonstrates how to create lagged features, moving averages, and time-based features, which are crucial for improving time series model performance.

4. **Multiple Model Training and Evaluation:**  Trains and evaluates several different models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ARIMA, and Prophet), providing a more robust analysis and allowing comparison of model performance. Includes a function `evaluate_model` to calculate and print RMSE, MAE, and MAPE for each model.

5. **Data Scaling:**  Scales the features using `StandardScaler` before training models that are sensitive to feature scaling (e.g., Gradient Boosting).

6. **Prophet Model:** Includes the Prophet model, which is specifically designed for time series forecasting and handles seasonality well.

7. **ARIMA Model:** Provides a basic ARIMA example.  In a real-world scenario, you would need to carefully tune the ARIMA model's parameters (p, d, q) using techniques like ACF and PACF plots and grid search.

8. **Visualization of Predictions:**  Includes a plot to visualize the actual vs. predicted values for one of the models (Gradient Boosting in this example), making it easier to assess the model's performance.

9. **Comments and Explanations:**  Added more comments and explanations throughout the code to make it easier to understand.


This enhanced code provides a more complete and practical example of analyzing and modeling the diesel price data.  Remember to further refine the models, explore additional features, and consider external data sources for even better performance.
